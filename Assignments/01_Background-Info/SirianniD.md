Assignment 01: Background Information
=====================================

In the beginning of our course, I'd like to learn some more information about
your background in science and programming, as well as your interest in data
science.  Please answer the following questions and save your assignment as
`lastnamefirstinitial.md` in this directory, and submit your responses via a
pull request upstream.

1. What year are you, what is your major, and what department are you in?

I'm a 5th year Chemistry PhD student.

2. What would you prefer to be called, i.e., do you have a nickname you'd prefer me
to use?

Doesn't really matter to me, but most folks call me Dom.

3. Do you have any experience in computing or computer programming (including
with R, Python, MatLab, etc.)?  If so, what is your level of familiarity with
these tools?

I have some basic familiarity with Matlab and I'm passable at C++, but I am an
experienced Python programmer with extensive familiarity with several common
Python libraries for scientific computing, including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, etc.

4. What got you interested in data science? Why did you choose to take this course?

Research.  One of my projects could be extended using machine learning techniques.

5. What are your goals for this course? What do you hope to learn and/or accomplish?

I hope to hone my skills as an instructor with respect to designing and delivering
lectures, and designing a course which offers direct experience for students with
the tools and comcepts taught.

6. What are your expectations for the instructors and TA for this course?

I expect to deliver content clearly, answer questions precisely and in an accessible
manner, and to get students excited about data science & scientific computing
