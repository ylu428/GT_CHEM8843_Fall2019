1. What year are you, what is your major, and what department are you in?
Ans: I'm a fouth year Chemistry PhD student.

2. What would you prefer to be called, i.e., do you have a nickname you'd prefer me to use?
Ans: I prefer to be called "Yi-Han" or "Yihan".

3. Do you have any experience in computing or computer programming (including with R, Python, MatLab, etc.)? If so, what is your level of familiarity with these tools?
Ans: I've learned Python, MatLab, R, Pearl and Excel VBA before, though I'm not very good at most of them. Now I mainly use Python to analysis my experimental data and make plots for presentation by matplotlib.

4. What got you interested in data science? Why did you choose to take this course?
Ans: I used to use only Excel and Origin to analysis my research data. When the data size is small, they work really great. But they are not very good at dealing with larger data. So I'm interestd in learning more data science skill to solve the problems. (And of course, the instructor is my advisor.) 

5. What are your goals for this course? What do you hope to learn and/or accomplish?
Ans: I'd like to be more fimilar with python, so I can easily modify my old code or write a new code without spending a lot of time searching answers from the Internet. I also like to know how to apply some existed algorithm such as PCA or HMM on my data through python.


6. What are your expectations for the instructors and TA for this course?
Ans: I hope the note or slides of the course content can be shared to us (if there are notes or slides). Sometime it is very difficult to listen to the class, trying to run the code on our computer and taking note at the same time.
