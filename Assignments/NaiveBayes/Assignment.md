Import the two csv files of unknown data and classify using priors and without using priors. As priors you will need to construct a probability vector based on a small subset of the data points.

The labeled data files will also need to be imported to train the model...  Figure out how to use train_test_split and use it for this task.

your goal is to use GaussianNB to classify data, with and without priors for the two different csv files. 

Compare the results in a histogram that plots both datasets on the same histogram.
