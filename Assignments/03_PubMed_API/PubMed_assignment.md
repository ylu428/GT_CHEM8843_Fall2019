## Read and understand the PubMed API documentation at: 
Create a PubMed object that GraphQL can use to query
Note that the parameters are not required but kindly requested by PubMed Central
https://pypi.org/project/pymed/
There are examples on this website of how to get this to work, and on the github page corresponding to this project:
https://github.com/gijswobben/pymed

I personally created a GraphQL query, but as long as you can get this to work 
with keywords in a flexible manner and read in article data, eventually building a dataframe from each search, you're good.

Try to get this working prior to class for a single search. 
At least get the syntax and code for a good search and try to get a pandas dataframe populated.
You will pool resources in class on Tuesday and improve your code, but I hope that everyone can contribute. 
We can then use these dataframes to learn about pandas and manipulating them.

I will also upload the arXiv file from today and place it in this same folder.

Let Dom, Baijie or me know if you have any questions.
