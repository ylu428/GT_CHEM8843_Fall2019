## Assignment:
Import csv as x, y1, y2, y3
find best fits to the polymonial datasets using sklearn.linear_model's LinearRegression
Use feature matrix for this... building a model, fitting, and predicting.
Calculate BIC for your fit to determine what number of parameters is best
Explain your results
for data in which the underlying functions are unknown, you can try fitting with a polynomial, 
or you can try fitting with an exponential decay (and sums of them). You'll have to know (or guess) k.
If you want to determine the actual function, figure out how to fit a function in scipy or some other library. 
Use these as the features (basis functions) and calculate your coefficients with LinearRegression and BIC 
to determine the optimal numbers of basis fucntions/parameters.

Explain the process, results, and how fitting and BIC/maximum likelihood works. Include info about distributions as appropriate.

### Please have this done by Tuesday, Oct 1, in class. 

### Again, feel free to work with others or Google things to get this done, but don't copy... learn. 

The book, chapter 5, especially, is very helpful. 

### Please turn in your work on github by class time.

We will start with a lecture on Bayesian Statistics for part of the class on Tuesday.

# Reminder, Tuesday's class will be in MoSE 3201A
